This skript allows one to canculate the the area of triangle

## 

You will need this skrip in case you want to calculate the area of a triangle and you know the coordinates of all three points

### Input

As input you should provide coordinates for all the three points of the triangle

### Output

As output of the skript working you will get the area of triangle calculated using the Gerone formula


### How to make the skript run
You should run the skript from terminal on Lunix or MacOS or from cmd on Windows. Probably you will need to write the full path to python

## 1
```
python argeparse_lesson.py 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
# As output you we see: 0
